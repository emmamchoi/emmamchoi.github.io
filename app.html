            <p class="desc">This project was made in a UI/UX class, with the goal of making finding affordable food more accessible and convenient. Drawing off my own experience as a college student who looks for affordable food, I thought that having one place to compare the price of an item from multiple places would be a new idea. If I wanted to find the cheapest place to obtain a product, I'd have to search on the separate sites, or in the stores themselves.</p>

            <p class="desc">I made a <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/jQQAgf53PlvKL5LrxviUx5/P2-Deliverable5?node-id=68%3A34" class="pageLink">wireframe</a> for the project on Figma, where it can be tested by clicking the "Present" button in the top-right corner. I had never made anything like this before, and I realized there was a lot of complexity in making it. Conceptually, I knew what I wanted to make, but having to make each part/interaction made me realize there's a lot more going on with this than I think about regularly.</p>

            <p class="desc">While I kept the logo and aesthetics pretty simple/secondary, I still worked to make it a pleasant experience. The logo imagery is inspired by Venn diagrams, as they are used in matters of comparison, like the aim of this app. I picked a light blue color for the overall scheme because it is calming and not too distracting.</p>
