            <p class="desc">This project was for a fashion drawing class, with the main objective being to design a runway outfit + a retail counterpart. First, we had to construct moodboards for the theme/idea, then the outfit and brand of our own. This was one of the first digital projects of the class, and helped expand my digital drawing skills.</p>

                <img src="images/ab1.png" alt="moodboard1" class="mb">
            </div>

            <p class="desc">Above are the two corresponding moodboards. I brought together the images and drew the figures using Adobe Photoshop, and created the ready-to-wear flat in Illustrator. This project helped me learn more about different layer modes in Photoshop (eg. multiply), depicting different fabric textures, and fashion flats. I'd previously done work on drawing figures, but had less experience in color and in digital medias. This was a nice expansion on my previous knowledge, and gave me some things to work more on in the future; the transparent fabric depiction was decent, but I think that there could be more done to show various fabric textures/include more fabric texture variety in my designs. I think some of these pieces could work well in a velvet-like material, which could then add another texture to the work.</p>
