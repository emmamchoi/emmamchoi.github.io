            <p class="desc">I made two vtuber models based on characters from Realm of the Mad God: <a class="pageLink" href="https://www.realmeye.com/wiki/thessal-the-mermaid-goddess">Thessal the Mermaid Goddess</a> and a skin of the ninja class, the <a class="pageLink" href="https://static.drips.pw/rotmg/wiki/Skins/Wind%20Flower%20Ninja.png">Wind Flower Ninja</a> . The illustrations were done in Photoshop, and rigged in Live2D. </p>

            <p class="desc">Thessal is a solely torso-up model as the model would primarily be used for video/streaming purposes. Additionally, I wanted to keep things simpler as this was my first time attempting a project like this. I also kept the back hair less detailed, so the overall style of the model may be a little inconsistent. Followed along with the standard Live2D tutorial, the model has very basic rigging; the mouth opens/closes and smiles/frowns, there is basic body/head rotation, and a breathing effect. I also rigged the hair and ears to move, and set it to the breathing in VTube Studio (input/tracking app) for a constant passive movement.</p>

            <p class="desc">For the Wind Flower model, I tried a full body illustration, though for most purposes the torso is all that is needed. Overall, her design was simpler, and I wanted to go for a more cute style. So, there were some differences in how I rigged the model, like the mouth. In a more anime-style way, the Wind Flower mouth was more exaggerated and rounded, bringing some more animated expressions.</p>
