            <p class="desc">This illustration was done for a winter/holiday-themed contest. It features a character design from Realm of the Mad God, <a href="https://www.realmeye.com/wiki/thessal-the-mermaid-goddess" class="pageLink">Thessal the Mermaid Goddess.</a> Imagining that she primarily spends time underwater, I thought that her interacting with the more land-locked winter wonders would be an interesting subject.</p>

            <p class="desc">Seeing as this is one of my more recent pieces, it utilizes more skills/tools than previous works. More of my current work includes both a solid/cel shading and a softer shade, often utilizing clipping masks and layers using multiply. This illustration was done on a relatively quick timeline, so is not too complex. The background isn't entirely concrete, but is meant to convey a cold, snow-like atmosphere. I think I could add some more details to the fabric texturing and the background, but overall I am relatively satisfied with the result.</p>
