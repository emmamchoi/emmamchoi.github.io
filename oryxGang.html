            <p class="desc">I created this banner for a contest hosted by the Realm of the Mad God Discord. The goal of the assignment was to make a server banner for the server. I chose to depict <a href="https://www.realmeye.com/wiki/oryx-the-mad-god-3" class="pageLink">Oryx the Mad God </a>3 + the 4 minibosses of <a href="https://www.realmeye.com/wiki/oryx-s-sanctuary" class="pageLink">Oryx's Sanctuary</a>. Since this dungeon is the ultimate engame of Realm of the Mad God, I thought it would be a fittingly dramatic and encompassing topic.</p>

            <p class="desc">This project was a somewhat small one, but still a nice challenge. RotMG has been my main intro to drawing topics like armor and fantasy themes, so at this point I was still not as familiar with this. Considering that this piece would have 5 figures, I went for a simpler style. This piece did end up winning 1st out of 10, and thus was the server banner for a time. Overall, I think that though this piece was relatively "simple," I still think it helped me with determining style and interpreting sprites in my own way.</p>
